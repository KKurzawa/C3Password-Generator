# Password Generator

## Description

This project generates random passwords based on criteria that the user choses. As most websites, apps, etc., utilize passwords the project suplies code to be used with and meet the demand of such sites. Being my first project utilizing JavaScript I learned to implement and use some basic principles of the language.

## Usage

Upon clicking the button 'Generate Password' the user is prompted to enter a password length between 8-128 characters. If the user enters anything other then a number or adds a number out of the range of 8-128 characters the user is prompted again with the same question. Once the user choses a number within in the correct range they are prompted to choose if they'd like to include lower case letters in their password by entering 'yes' or 'no'. If the user types anything other then 'yes' or 'no' they will be prompted again with the same question, otherwise they will be prompted with the next question. The following 3 prompts ask questions of wether the user would like to include upper case letters, numbers, and/or special characters and follow the same pattern of functionality as the 'lower case letters' prompt. If the user clicks 'cancel' at anytime the prompt disappears. If the user answers 'no' to all questions regarding which type of character to include an alert appears saying they need to reply 'yes' to at least one of the questions. If the user answers 'yes' to at least one of the questions a random password is generated and displayed in the box above the 'Generate Password' box. The described steps are displayed in the screenshots below.
